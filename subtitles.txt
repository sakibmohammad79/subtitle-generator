# Format: start_time | end_time | text

0.0 | 5.0 | In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
5.5 | 10.0 | O you wrapped in garments (Prophet Muhammad)!
10.5 | 16.0 | Stand (to pray) all night, except a little—
16.5 | 22.0 | Half of it, or a little less than that,
22.5 | 29.0 | Or a little more. And recite the Quran with measured recitation.
29.5 | 35.5 | Verily, We shall send down to you a weighty Word.
36.0 | 44.0 | Indeed, the hours of the night are more effective for worship and more upright in speech.
44.5 | 51.0 | For you by day is prolonged occupation.
51.5 | 58.5 | And remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with complete devotion.
59.0 | 66.0 | Lord of the East and the West; there is no deity except Him, so take Him as Disposer of affairs.
67.0 | 74.0 | And be patient over what they say and avoid them with gracious avoidance.
74.5 | 83.0 | And leave Me with the deniers, the possessors of ease [in life], and allow them respite a little.
84.0 | 90.0 | Indeed, with Us are shackles and burning fire,
90.5 | 96.0 | And food that chokes and a painful punishment—
96.5 | 106.0 | On the Day the earth and the mountains will quake and the mountains will become a heap of sand flowing down.
106.5 | 116.0 | Indeed, We have sent to you a Messenger as a witness upon you, as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger.
116.5 | 124.0 | But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger, so We seized him with a ruinous seizure.
124.5 | 134.0 | Then how can you fear, if you disbelieve, a Day that will make the children white-haired?
134.5 | 143.0 | The heaven will break apart therefrom; ever is His promise fulfilled.
143.5 | 152.0 | Indeed, this is a reminder; so whoever wills may take to his Lord a way.
153.0 | 168.0 | Indeed, your Lord knows that you stand in prayer almost two-thirds of the night or half of it or a third of it,
169.0 | 178.0 | And a group of those with you. And Allah determines the night and the day.
179.0 | 188.0 | He knows that you will not be able to continue it and has turned to you in forgiveness,
189.0 | 195.0 | So recite what is easy [for you] of the Quran.
196.0 | 205.0 | He knows that there will be among you those who are ill and others traveling through the land,
206.0 | 212.0 | seeking [something] of the bounty of Allah and others fighting for the cause of Allah.
213.0 | 218.0 | So recite what is easy from it and establish prayer and give zakah,
219.0 | 224.0 | And loan Allah a goodly loan. And whatever good you put forward for yourselves, you will find it with Allah.
