1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,000
O you wrapped in garments (Prophet Muhammad)!

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,000
Stand (to pray) all night, except a little—

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,000
Half of it, or a little less than that,

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:29,000
Or a little more. And recite the Quran with measured recitation.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Verily, We shall send down to you a weighty Word.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Indeed, the hours of the night are more effective for worship and more upright in speech.

8
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:51,000
For you by day is prolonged occupation.

9
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:58,500
And remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with complete devotion.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Lord of the East and the West; there is no deity except Him, so take Him as Disposer of affairs.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And be patient over what they say and avoid them with gracious avoidance.

12
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:23,000
And leave Me with the deniers, the possessors of ease [in life], and allow them respite a little.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Indeed, with Us are shackles and burning fire,

14
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,000
And food that chokes and a painful punishment—

15
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:46,000
On the Day the earth and the mountains will quake and the mountains will become a heap of sand flowing down.

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:56,000
Indeed, We have sent to you a Messenger as a witness upon you, as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger.

17
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:04,000
But Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger, so We seized him with a ruinous seizure.

18
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:14,000
Then how can you fear, if you disbelieve, a Day that will make the children white-haired?

19
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:23,000
The heaven will break apart therefrom; ever is His promise fulfilled.

20
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:32,000
Indeed, this is a reminder; so whoever wills may take to his Lord a way.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Indeed, your Lord knows that you stand in prayer almost two-thirds of the night or half of it or a third of it,

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And a group of those with you. And Allah determines the night and the day.

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He knows that you will not be able to continue it and has turned to you in forgiveness,

24
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So recite what is easy [for you] of the Quran.

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He knows that there will be among you those who are ill and others traveling through the land,

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
seeking [something] of the bounty of Allah and others fighting for the cause of Allah.

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So recite what is easy from it and establish prayer and give zakah,

28
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And loan Allah a goodly loan. And whatever good you put forward for yourselves, you will find it with Allah.
