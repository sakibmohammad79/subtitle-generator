1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
When the sky is torn apart,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And when the planets are scattered,

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,740
And when the seas are destroyed,

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,899
And when the graves are torn to pieces,

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:43,140
A soul will know what it has preceded and delayed.

8
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:54,420
O man, what has deceived you in your Lord, the Generous?

9
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:08,420
Who created you, and proportioned you, and made you just in any form that He willed to assemble you.

10
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:21,420
No, but you deny the religion. And indeed, upon you are guardians

11
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:41,420
Honorable and writing. They know what you do. Indeed, the righteous are in bliss.

12
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:59,420
And indeed, the wicked are in Hellfire. They will be cast into Hellfire on the Day of Recompense, and they will not escape from it.

13
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:17,420
And what can make you know what is the Day of Recompense? Then what can make you know what is the Day of Recompense?

14
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:25,019
On the Day when no soul will possess anything for another soul.

15
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:31,019
And the command on that Day is for Allah.
