1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
In the name of Allah, the Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and the most powerful, saying,

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Indeed, for you in the day is a long morning.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And remember the name of your Lord and turn to Him in turn.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Lord of the East and the West, there is no god but He, so take him as a guardian.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,520
And be patient with what they say, and leave them a beautiful place of refuge.

7
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:08,120
And leave Me and the deniers, the owners of grace, and give them a little time.

8
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:14,200
Indeed, We have a place of refuge and a place of fire,

9
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,760
And food that is full of bitterness and a painful punishment.

10
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:34,680
On the Day when the earth and the mountains will be turned upside down, and the mountains will be a

11
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:42,120
as We sent to Pharaoh a messenger.

12
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:49,840
Then Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger, and We took him as a slave and a slave.

13
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:58,800
So how can you be afraid if you disbelieve on a day when He will make the children a slave?

14
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:08,479
The sky is made to be a place of rest for him. His promise was fulfilled.

15
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:18,759
Indeed, this is a reminder. So whoever wills, take to his Lord a way.

16
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:28,519
Indeed, your Lord knows that you stand less than a third of the night and half of it and a third.

17
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:42,280
And its half and its third and a group of those with you. And Allah decides the night and the day.

18
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:52,320
He knows that you will not be counted, so He has repented against you. So read what is easier than the Qur'an.

19
00:02:52,319 --> 00:03:08,560
He knows that there will be among you a disease, and others will struggle in the land seeking the bounty of Allah.

20
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:20,080
And others fight in the cause of Allah. So read what is easy for you.

21
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:29,039
And establish prayer and give zakat and lend to Allah a good debt.

22
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:48,560
And whatever you offer for yourselves of good, you find it with Allah. It is good and the greatest reward.

23
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:58,319
And ask forgiveness of Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.
